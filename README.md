# BLOCK-CHAIN-ASSIGNMENT-
Q. Define blockchain in your own words (100â€“150 words)
A blockchain is like a digital notebook that keeps records of transactions or data in a very secure way. It stores information in blocks. Each block has its own unique code called a hash, and it also stores the hash of the previous block â€” linking them like a chain. This makes it very difficult to change any information because if you change one block, you have to change all the blocks after it. Blockchain is decentralized, meaning no single person or company controls it. Instead, itâ€™s shared among many users in a network, making it transparent, secure, and trustworthy.

Q. List 2 real-life use cases:

Supply Chain Management: To track a product from manufacturing to delivery, every step is recorded on a blockchain for transparency.

Digital Identity: Storing personal IDs like passports and certificates securely on a blockchain to avoid identity theft or fake documents.

Q. Draw a block showing: data, previous hash, timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root.

Q. How does the Merkle Root help verify data integrity? (with example)
A Merkle Root is a unique code made by combining the hashes of all transactions inside a block. It is like a final summary of the entire blockâ€™s data. If even one transaction inside the block is changed, the Merkle Root will also change.
For example: if there are 4 transactions A, B, C, D â€” each will have its own hash. These hashes are paired and combined to form new hashes until one final Merkle Root is made. If any transaction (like A) changes, its hash changes, which affects the whole chain of hashes and the final Merkle Root, instantly showing that the data has been tampered with.

ðŸ“– Consensus Conceptualization
Q. What is Proof of Work and why does it require energy?
Proof of Work (PoW) is a method where computers in a blockchain network solve difficult mathematical problems to add a new block. The first computer to solve the problem gets to add the block and earn rewards. It requires a lot of energy because many computers work together, competing to solve the problem, which takes a lot of computing power and electricity.

Q. What is Proof of Stake and how does it differ?
Proof of Stake (PoS) is another way to select who will add the next block in a blockchain. Instead of solving puzzles, users with more cryptocurrency coins (stakes) have a higher chance to be selected. It uses much less energy because there is no need for computers to keep solving problems.

Q. What is Delegated Proof of Stake and how are validators selected?
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) works by letting people in the network vote for a few trusted users called delegates. These delegates are responsible for adding new blocks and maintaining the blockchain. The more votes a delegate has, the higher their chances of being selected to validate transactions. Itâ€™s faster and more efficient than PoW and PoS.
